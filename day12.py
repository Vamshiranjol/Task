# Sample doctor's note
text = """
Dr. Samantha Rodriguez, a senior cardiologist at St. Maryâ€™s Hospital,
reviewed the patient's echocardiogram results and noted signs of left ventricular hypertrophy, 
likely secondary to longstanding hypertension. She recommended initiating a beta-blocker in 
combination with ACE inhibitors, advised dietary sodium restriction, and scheduled a cardiology
follow-up in four weeks. During the consultation, the doctor also discussed the importance of
medication adherence, regular blood pressure monitoring, and potential referral to a 
nephrologist if renal function continues to decline."
